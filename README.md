# Steganography-Encryption

Steganography is the practice of concealing messages or information into an image's
pixel data. This software allows you to encrypt entire books, texts, or millions of
bytes of data into a single image without losing any noticeable image quality. The
picture will retain the information ciphered into it while looking identical to the
input image. The encrypted text is compressed into the pixel data so the file size
does change with ciphering.
